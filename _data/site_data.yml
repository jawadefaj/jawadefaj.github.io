  - title: "Heroes of '71"
    description: >
      Heroes of ’71 is a landmark third-person shooter set during the
      Bangladesh Liberation War. I built the enemy-AI, grenade mechanics, and
      level-design toolkit in Unity—helping the title reach more than 7 million
      downloads and 300 000 + monthly active users. Praised for culturally
      authentic storytelling, the game remains a benchmark for South-Asian
      interactive media.

  - title: "Heroes of 71 : Retaliation"
    description: >
      The sequel amps up the franchise with tighter first-person gunplay,
      dynamic movement, and varied mission design. I introduced a playable
      female freedom-fighter, expanded AI behaviours, and integrated
      ad-monetisation plus IAP flows—driving the series past 30 million
      aggregate downloads.

    description: >
      Free-to-play strategy game where players manage a guerrilla camp across
      20 historically inspired battles. I created the terrain tool, inventory
      module, and a Unity code-obfuscation pipeline that reduced load times by
      35% while deterring reverse-engineering.
