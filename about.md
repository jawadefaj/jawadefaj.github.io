        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>Hello! I'm <span class="highlighted-term">Abdul Jawad</span>, a Ph.D. candidate in <span class="highlighted-term">Computational Media</span> at the 
        <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" class="highlighted-term">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, specializing in human driver behavior modeling to advance simulation-based 
        <span class="highlighted-term">autonomous vehicle (AV) testing</span>. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in <span class="highlighted-term">Computer Science and Engineering</span> from the 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</span>, followed by a Master's in Computational Media at UCSC.</p>

        <h3>Game Development & Industry Contributions</h3>
        <p>My passion for <span class="highlighted-term">game development</span> led me to co-found a game studio in Bangladesh during my sophomore year. I’ve published several successful games, including the culturally significant 
        "<span class="highlighted-term">Heroes of 71</span>," which has amassed over 10 million downloads. Throughout this journey, I’ve taken on roles as a 
        <span class="highlighted-term">game programmer</span> and <span class="highlighted-term">level designer</span>, honing my skills in creating immersive gaming experiences.</p>

        <p>At UCSC, I aimed to deepen my understanding of <span class="highlighted-term">game development</span> and <span class="highlighted-term">game engine technology</span>. This journey led to my involvement in a 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Ford-funded project</span> where I developed synthetic road networks using the 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Unreal Engine</span> for AV testing simulations. My current research builds on this experience, focusing on generating realistic accident scenarios through 
        <span class="highlighted-term">human driver modeling</span>, thereby enhancing AV testing accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
        <p>My technical expertise spans multiple domains. In programming, I am proficient in <span class="highlighted-term">Python</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">C++</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">C#</span>, and 
        <span class="highlighted-term">JavaScript</span>. I have extensive experience with data analysis and visualization tools such as 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Anaconda</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">Matplotlib</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">Pandas</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">NumPy</span>, and 
        <span class="highlighted-term">OpenCV</span>. My machine learning skills are supported by knowledge of frameworks like <span class="highlighted-term">PyTorch</span>, 
        <span class="highlighted-term">scikit-learn</span>, and <span class="highlighted-term">OpenAI Gym</span>.</p>

        <p>In the realm of <span class="highlighted-term">game development</span>, I am experienced with engines like <span class="highlighted-term">Unreal Engine 4</span>, 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Unity</span>, and <span class="highlighted-term">Phaser.JS</span>. For AV simulation, I am proficient with tools such as 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Carla</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">Apollo</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">RoadRunner</span>, 
        <span class="highlighted-term">SUMO</span>, <span class="highlighted-term">Esmini</span>, and formats like <span class="highlighted-term">OpenDRIVE</span> and 
        <span class="highlighted-term">OpenSCENARIO</span>.</p>

        <h3>Academic & Professional Engagement</h3>
        <p>My work in <span class="highlighted-term">autonomous vehicles</span> and <span class="highlighted-term">game development</span> has led me to actively contribute to the academic community. I have organized workshops, 
        reviewed papers for <span class="highlighted-term">IEEE</span> conferences, and participated in prestigious events like the 
        <span class="highlighted-term">IEEE IV 2023 SceGen workshop</span>. I regularly attend conferences such as <span class="highlighted-term">ITS</span> and 
        <span class="highlighted-term">ADAS</span>, where I stay at the forefront of advancements in intelligent transportation systems. My achievements have been recognized with awards like the 
        <span class="highlighted-term">Campus2Career Youth Award</span> and the <span class="highlighted-term">National ICT Award</span> in 2016.</p>

        <h3>Personal Interests & Mentorship</h3>
        <p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I have a deep passion for <span class="highlighted-term">chess</span>, which I engage in almost daily. I am also committed to mentoring the next generation of researchers. 
        Each year, I volunteer in UCSC’s <span class="highlighted-term">Summer Internship Program (SIP)</span>, guiding high school students as they develop their research skills and gain invaluable experience.</p>
