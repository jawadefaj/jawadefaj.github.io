    <div class="about-text">

        <p>Jawad is a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational Media with a focus on human driver behavior modeling to assist simulation-based autonomous vehicle testing. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology before completing his Master of Science in Computational Media at UCSC.</p>

        <p>Jawad has a strong background in game development and co-founded a game studio in Bangladesh while he was a sophomore. He has published several games, including "Heroes of 71," a culturally significant game with over 10 million downloads. Over the course of this period, he was mainly in the roles of game programmer and level designer.</p>

        <p>Jawad joined UCSC with the aim of deepening his understanding of game development and game engine technology. His journey soon led him to participate in a Ford-funded project focusing on the generation of synthetic road networks in the Unreal game engine for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing in simulations. His current research revolves around creating realistic accident scenarios through human driver modeling, enhancing the verification of AV driving capabilities.</p>

        <p>Jawad's skill set is anchored in a strong technical background, spanning multiple domains. In programming, he is proficient in Python, C++, C#, and JavaScript. His skills extend to data analysis and visualization tools like Anaconda, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and OpenCV, along with machine learning libraries such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenAI Gym. In game development, Jawad is experienced with various game engines, including Unreal Engine 4, Unity, and Phaser.JS. In the autonomous vehicle simulation domain, he is proficient in simulation tools such as Carla, Apollo, RoadRunner, SUMO, Esmini, and specialized formats like OpenDRIVE and OpenSCENARIO.</p>

        <p>He has also been involved in organizing workshops and reviewing papers for IEEE conferences, notably the 1st SceGen workshop at IEEE IV 2023 and serving as a reviewer for IEEE ITSC 2022 and IEEE TOG 2021. He is a regular attendee at Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) conferences. His academic and professional achievements have been recognized through awards such as the Campus2Career Youth Award in 2016 and the National ICT Award in 2016.</p>

        <p>Beyond his professional endeavors, Jawad is deeply passionate about chess, engaging in the game almost daily. In addition to these interests, Jawad is committed to mentoring and teaching. He dedicates time each year to volunteer in the summer internship program (SIP) at UCSC, guiding high school students in developing research skills and gaining valuable experiences.</p>
