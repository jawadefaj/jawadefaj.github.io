I am a Ph.D. candidate in the computational media at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California Santa Cruz </a>, specializing in human driver behavior modeling for 
autonomous vehicle testing. My educational journey started with a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, 
then I went on to earn a master's in computational media at UCSC. <br> 

My passion for game development led me to co-found a game studio in Bangladesh during my sophomore year, where I 
developed "Heroes of 71," a game that received huge attention due to its cultural significance. At UCSC, I expanded my expertise into game engine technology, 
contributing to a Ford-funded project on synthetic road network generation for AV simulation. <br>
 
My technical skill set spans across programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, and extends to data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. 
I am also an active participant in ITS and ADAS conferences and take pride in mentoring students through UCSC's summer internship program, combining my love 
for chess and commitment to teaching.
