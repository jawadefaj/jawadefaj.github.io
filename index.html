    <p>Welcome! I'm Abdul Jawad, a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Media at the 
    <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, where I specialize in creating cutting-edge tools for 
    <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">autonomous vehicle (AV)</span> testing and simulation. My journey began with a passion for 
    <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">game development</span>, which led me to co-found a successful game studio in Bangladesh and develop the widely popular title "Heroes of 71."</p>

    <p>At UCSC, I've combined my love for 
    <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">gaming technology</span> and 
    <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">AR/VR development</span> with advanced 
    <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">machine learning</span> to push the boundaries of AV simulation. I’ve contributed to key projects like 
    <em>WaveFormer</em>, focusing on machine learning, and <em>CogMod</em>, a cognitive model that simulates realistic human driving behaviors to enhance AV testing. 
    My work in <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">reinforcement learning</span>-based scenario generation has recently been published in the 
    <em><span style="color: #3aa3c3;">IEEE ITSC</span></em>.</p>

    <p>With a strong foundation in <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">Python</span>, <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">C++</span>, and data-driven solutions, 
    my research and technical contributions have been recognized in top venues like 
    <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">ITSC</span>, <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">IV</span>, and <span style="color: #3aa3c3;">SAE</span>. 
    Beyond research, I’m passionate about teaching and have mentored students in game-related courses and UCSC's summer internship program.</p>
