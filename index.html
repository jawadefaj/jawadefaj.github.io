My name is Abdul Jawad, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California Santa Cruz </a>. My research involves modeling human 
driving behavior to assist simulation-based autonomous vehicle testing. My goal is to accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles by improving their 
testing process through advanced simulation techniques. In addition to <a href="/research/">publishing</a> at academic conferences, I have contributed to <a href="/projects">open-source projects</a> 
related to AV simulation tool development. The tools are primarily developed in Python and C++. I have been using Unreal and Unity game engines for seven years due to my exposure to game development.


I am primarily interested in modeling behaviors for simulation-based AV testing for my dissertation project.

<br>
I received my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh. I co-founded a game studio and published four Andriod games 
during my undergraduate. In 2018, I moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz, to pursue a PhD in the Computational 
Media Department.
