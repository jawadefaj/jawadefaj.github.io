		<b>CogMod: Cognitive Modeling of Human Driving Behavior</b><br>
		UCSC, 2021-Present<br>
		<!-- <b><i>Advisor: Jim Whitehead</i></b><br> -->
		<i>CogMod is human driver behavior model based on theories from two complementary cognitive architectures QN-MHP and ACT-R that can simulate a number of human limitations to represent human cognition while driving. CogMod limits the perception of the agents by providing selective update of the surrounding. The model can simulate human drivers' perceptive and cognitive limitations and thereby capture human driving variability.</i> <br>

		<b>JunctionArt: Road Network Generation for Autonomous Vehicle Testing</b><br>
		UCSC, 2020-Present<br>
		<b><i>Collaborator: Golam Md Muktadir, Abdul Jawad, Ishaan Paranjape, Jim Whitehead, and Aleksey Shepelev</i></b><br>
		<i>JunctionArt is a road generation tool that can procedurally create road networks and intersections.  Generated roads exhibit different types of lane types such as turn lanes, one way streets, and multiple lanes, while intersections feature a range of incident roads (three to seven incident roads), leading to a variety of geometries and interior connecting lanes. These roads are output in the OpenDRIVE format, and hence are interoperable with a wide range of Autonomous Vehicle testing tools and simulation environments such as Carla, RoadRunner.</i> <br>

        <b>CruzWay: A Modular Architecture for Generating Scenarios to Test Autonomous Vehicles</b><br>
        UCSC, 2018-2019<br>
		<b><i>Collaborator: Ishaan Paranjape, Abdul Jawad, Yanwen Xu, Asiiah Song, Jim Whitehead</i></b><br>
        <i>CruzWay is a modular architecture that supports procedural generation of town sized road networks and intersections. CruzWay can generate scenarios with cars as well as pedestrians run by behavior trees (BTs) in the procedurally generated environment. The self-contained, modular nature of BTs in combination with procedural roads allows CruzWay to create a large number of scenarios.  </i><br>
