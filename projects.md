		<b>3D Saqqara - An Interactive Egypt</b>: This project brings historical visualization to VR, focusing on the ancient site of Saqqara across different timelines. The project was developed using the Unity game engine and HTC Vive. The VR experience reconstructs missing components and textures of the historical site from specific time periods using tools like Blender. The immersive experience allows users to explore Saqqara in three distinct timelines, offering first-person and bird's eye views for a comprehensive understanding of the site's evolution. The project's highlight is its approach to visualizing uncertainty in historical interpretation, presenting the site in an unbiased manner and enhanced by immersive 3D sounds and a user-friendly navigation interface. This VR experience not only educates but also engages users in a deep, sensory exploration of Egypt's rich historical landscape.<br>
