#   - title: "CogMod: Cognitive Modeling of Human Driving Behavior"
#     date: "UCSC, 2021 – Present"
#     overview: >
#       CogMod is a human driver behavior model based on theories from cognitive
#       architecture and traffic modeling. It simulates various human limitations
#       to represent human cognition while driving, limiting agents’ perception
#       by providing selective updates of the surroundings. This model captures
#       the variability in human driving by simulating perceptive and cognitive
#       limitations and helps create diverse, critical accident scenarios for
#       autonomous-vehicle testing.
